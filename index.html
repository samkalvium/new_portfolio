                        <p>Following steps of great Software Developers, My dream is to become a one of the best
                            Software Developer. As I even have little intrest in business, I have a dream of

                            this
                            quote from late president Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam:-"It does not matter how large or small your
                            sphere of activity is, what counts finally is the commitment that you bring to the job that
                            has been
                            ordained for you in this life."Following on the guidence of my mentors and role models one
                            day
                            i am gonna accomplish my goal and become succesfull.

                    <p>My skills are kind of differet from others as i have different taste or a different point of view on this world
                        my skills are not really professional and are like drfiting cars, performing stunts in bikes, without
                        getting wrecked. More than defining these as unprofessional we can say like "ILLEGAL" i think. So talking about my
                        professional skills i have few of them like communication skills, I am good at convincing people sometimes then i 
                        have leart few programming languages like C++,HTML,JavaScript and CSS.I have good knowledge of video and photo editing
                        and even photoghraphy and videography.
